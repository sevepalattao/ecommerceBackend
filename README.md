# E-commerce Backend

## Description

For this challenge it was my job to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I started with a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The API uses express, mysql2, sequelize, and dotenv. To create the database in the mysql shell, I ran the command ```source schema.sql```
To seed the database I ran the command ``` node seeds/index.js```
To start the application's server, I ran the command ```node server.js```

This video shows the commands above as well as Insomnia testing each CRUD operation of the API.
